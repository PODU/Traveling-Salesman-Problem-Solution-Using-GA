<h1><u>Traveling Salesman Problem Solution Using Genetic Algorithm</u></h1>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Javascript implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem Solution Generation using a <b>Genetic Algorithm</b>. In this project the user can create a map of all the points he/she has to visit and then start the algorithm. The algorithm will find the shortest path for you to travel to all the mapped points and then return to the starting position with the minimum distance needed to be covered.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can even test the system by using the pre-defined datasets in which the system can randomly select any <br>10 cities from the world<br>10 countries<br>10 cities in India<br>10 Places in Pune.
